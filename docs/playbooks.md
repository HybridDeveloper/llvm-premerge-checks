## deployment to a clean infrastructure

General remarks:
* GCP does not route any traffic to your services unless the service is "healthy". It might take a few minutes after startup before the services is classified as healthy. Until then you will only see some generic error message.

These are the steps to set up the build server on a clean infrastructure:  
1. Configure the tools on your local machine:
    ```bash
    ./local_setup.sh
    ```
   If you not running docker under your user, you might need to
   `sudo gcloud auth login --no-launch-browser && gcloud auth configure-docker`
   before running other commands under sudo.
1. Delete the old cluster, if it still exists:
    ```bash
    cd kubernetes/cluster
    ./cluster_delete.sh
    ```
1. Create the cluster:
    ```bash
    cd kubernetes/cluster
    ./cluster_create.sh
    ```
1. Create the disk storage, if it does not yet exist:
    ```bash
    cd kubernetes/cluster
    ./disk_create.sh
    ```
1. SSH into the VM instance mounting the volume, find the mount point and then set
    ```bash
    # go to the mount point of the volume
    cd  /var/lib/kubelet/plugins/kubernetes.io/gce-pd/mounts/jenkins-home
    # change the permissions
    sudo chmod a+rwx
    ```
1. Push the docker images to gcr.io:
    ```bash
    cd containers
    #for each subfolder:
    ./build_deploy.sh <foldername>
    ```
1. Deploy the stack:
    ```bash
    cd kubernetes
    ./deploy.sh
    ```
1. Configure it

## creating basic authentication for reverse proxy

1. create auth file, based on [ingress-nginx documentation](https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx/tree/master/docs/examples/auth/basic)
    ```bash
    cd kubernetes/reverse-proxy
    htpasswd -c auth <username>
    # enter password at prompt
    # add more users as required
    kubectl create secret generic proxy-auth --from-file=auth --namespace=jenkins
    ```

## Creating docker containers on Windows

If you want to build/update/test docker container for Windows, you need to do this on a Windows machine.

**Note**: There is an existing *windows-development* machine that you can resume and use for development. Please stop it after use.

Here are the instructions to set up such a machine on GCP.

1. Pick a GCP Windows image with Desktop Support.
    * pick a "persistent SSD" as boot Disk. This is much faster
    * (optionally) add a "local scratch SSD" and use it as you workspace. This will make builds faster, but you **will not be able to stop** this instance and will have to kill and re-create it again.
    * make sure that you give enough permissions in "Identity and API access" to be able to e.g. push new docker images to GCR. 
    
1. Format the local SSD partition and use it as workspace.
1. install [Chocolately](https://chocolatey.org/docs/installation):
    ```powershell
    iex ((new-object net.webclient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    ```
1. Install development tools: `choco install -y git googlechrome vscode`
1. (optionally) If you want to be able to push changes to github, you need to set up your github SSH keys and user name:
    ```powershell
    ssh-keygen
    git config --global user.name <your name>
    git config --global user.email <your email>
    ```
1. Install [Docker Enterprise](https://docs.docker.com/ee/docker-ee/windows/docker-ee/) and reboot:
    ```powershell
    Install-Module DockerMsftProvider -Force
    Install-Package Docker -ProviderName DockerMsftProvider -Force
    Restart-Computer
    ```
1. Configure the Docker credentials for GCP:
    ```powershell
    gcloud init # set options according to ./k8s_config here
    gcloud components install docker-credential-gcr
    docker-credential-gcr configure-docker
    ```
1. To build and run the current agent run:
    ```powershell
    cd c:\
    git clone https://github.com/google/llvm-premerge-checks
    cd llvm-premerge-checks\containers
    .\build_deploy.ps1 agent-windows-buildkite # or agent-windows-jenkins
    c:\llvm-premerge-check\scripts\windows_agent_start_buildkite.ps1 # or windows_agent_start_jenkins.ps1
    ```

## Spawning a new windows agent

To spawn a new windows agent:

1. Go to the [GCP page](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/compute/instances?project=llvm-premerge-checks&instancessize=50) and pick a new number for the agent.
1. Run `kubernetes/windows_agent_create.sh agent-windows-<number>`
1. Go to the [GCP page](https://pantheon.corp.google.com/compute/instances?project=llvm-premerge-checks&instancessize=50) again 
1. Login to the new machine via RDP (you will need a RDP client, e.g. Chrome app).
1. In the RDP session: run these commands in the CMD window under Administrator to bootstrap the Windows machine:
    ```powershell 
    Invoke-WebRequest -uri 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/llvm-premerge-checks/master/scripts/windows_agent_bootstrap.ps1' -OutFile windows_agent_bootstrap.ps1
    ./windows_agent_bootstrap.ps1
    ```
    Ignore the pop-up to format the new disk andw wait for the machine to reboot.
    
### Buildkite
 
1. Create `c:\credentials` folder with file `buildkite-env.ps1`:
    ```powershell
    $Env:buildkiteAgentToken = "secret-token"
    $Env:BUILDKITE_AGENT_TAGS = "queue=premerge,os=windows"
    $Env:CONDUIT_TOKEN = "conduit-api-token"
    ```   
1. Run
   ```powershell
   C:\llvm-premerge-checks\scripts\windows_agent_start_buildkite.ps1 [-workdir D:/] [-testing] [-version latest]
   ```
   
### Jenkins
   1. Create `c:\credentials` folder with `build-agent-results_key.json` to access cloud storage copy from one of the existing machines.
   1. Run
   ```powershell
   C:\llvm-premerge-checks\scripts\windows_agent_start_buildkite.ps1 [-testing] [-version latest]
   ```

## Testing scripts locally

Build and run agent docker image `sudo ./containers/build_run.sh agent-debian-testing-ssd /bin/bash`.

Within a container set environment variables similar to [pipeline](https://github.com/google/llvm-premerge-checks/blob/master/Jenkins/Phabricator-pipeline/Jenkinsfile).

Additionally set `WORKSPACE`, `PHID` and `DIFF_ID` parameters. Set `CONDUIT_TOKEN` with your personal one from `https://reviews.llvm.org/settings/user/<USERNAME>/page/apitokens/`.


# Phabricator integration

The general flow for builds on Phabricator is:
1. A user uploads a *Diff* (=patch) to a *Revision* (set of Diffs with comments and buildstatus, ... ).
2. A *Herald* checks if one of the *rules* matches this event. 
3. You can use the rules to trigger a *Build* in *Harbormaster*.
4. Harbor sends an HTTP request to the Jenkins server.
5. Jenkins executes the build. In the last step of the build, a script is uploading the results to Phabricator.
6. Phabricator sets the build status and displays the results.

## Herald

We currently have these Herald rules to configure the builds:
* Triggering builds for everyone:
    * [H576](https://reviews.llvm.org/H576) This will only trigger for non-beta testers.
* Triggering the beta-test builds:
    * [H511](https://reviews.llvm.org/H511) or the beta testers, this is for testing new features.
    * [H552](https://reviews.llvm.org/H552) for all changes to MLIR (archived)
    * [H527](https://reviews.llvm.org/H527) for all changes to clang-extra-tools (archived)

You can *archive* a rule to disable it.

## Harbormaster

We have these build plans in Harbormaster:
* [Plan 4](https://reviews.llvm.org/harbormaster/plan/4/) Builds for everyone
* [Plan 3](https://reviews.llvm.org/harbormaster/plan/3/) Builds for beta testers

You can *disable* a build plan to stop it from building.

## Per user Opt in/out

You can also on a per-user bases opt in/out to premerge testing. 
* To opt-in to pre-merge beta testing, add yourself to this project:
https://reviews.llvm.org/project/view/78/
* To opt-out of pre-merge testing entirely, add yourself to this project:
https://reviews.llvm.org/project/view/83/

These projects are checked in the Herald rules above.
